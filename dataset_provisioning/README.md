# Dataset Provisioning for TRE Workspace

This is a Dataset Provisioning pipeline. It provides a mechanism to provision datasets created within FlowEHR and into Azure TRE workspaces. 
This example pipeline copies data created within Databricks Unity Catalogue (see TODO link) into an Azure TRE workspace.

To be able to use Dataset Provisioning pipeline, a special TRE Workspace needs to be used. See a template available here: TODO.

# How to set up

Deploy the pipeline as normal. The pipeline can then be triggered from the ADF instance, as shown:
